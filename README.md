# Frontend technical task

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

## Development

Run `npm run dev` to run the development server.

## Limitations

- The answers are in the same order for all options
- Toggle transitions are a bit clunky in mobile mode
- Responsiveness changes the size of the toggle for all options, not just the one that is 'too big'
- All questions in 'question bank' would have to follow the same interface structure (question, answer: correct, incorrect)

## Future features

- Randomisation of answer order
- Refactor code to make it easier to maintain and extend
